I always learn various new things to achieve my goals 🪐✨

Have knlowledge in:
• C++
• Java
• SQL

This year goals are:
• Design and build my portfolio
• Publish my application on App store!
• finishing my open source project >> will provide the details once it done⏳

Love and live by the fact that EVERY thing around me has been build by human who has the same brain that I have and I can build and do the same and even more!!!

Have interest in:
• Cyber security 
• AI and ML particularly 

Basically I am an eager learner who wants to know and do everything by themselves and that's probably why I'm depressed 🐒
However I have a good team spirit and Leader By nature 😇
