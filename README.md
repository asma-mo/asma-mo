I always learn various new things to achieve my goals 🪐✨

Have knlowledge in:
• C++
• Java
• SQL
• Java Script

This year goals are:
• Learn UI/UX design => progress: 65%
• Learn python => progress: 40%

Love and live by the fact that everything around me has been built by humans who have the same brain that I have, and I can build and do the same, and even more!

Have interest in:
• Cyber security 
• AI and ML particularly
• Optical Computing 

Basically, I am an eager learner who wants to know and do everything by myself, and That's probably the reason I'm depressed 🐒,
However, I have a good team spirit and I'm a natural leader 😇
